# starscore-quiz

For this assignment, I was instructed to create a functioning 'Code Quiz' that will allow the user to answer a few questions and the oportunity to save their quiz score. To construct this assignment, I used HTML, JavaScript, as well as CSS. The local storage feature will allow the user to save said score so they can view it as they please. The application will display a link in the homepage that will allow the user to see the highscore of other players as well. It features a timer that goes down by 50 seconds if the user gets a question wrong. Eventually, if the user answers enough questions wrong the timer will hit 0 and end the game. If the user is able to answer the questions correctly it will display them all and give them their score at the end of the game. 

The assignment also features working buttons for the questions, to begin the quiz, to enter their initials for their score, back button and an erase score button. I have named this assignment "Starscores.




## USER STORY

As the student
I WANT to create a quiz that allows my users to answer a series of questions and save their scores while being timed 
SO THAT when other users play they can try to beat the highest score
